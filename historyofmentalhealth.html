<h3>The History</h3>  
    
<p> <a href="https://www.uniteforsight.org/mental-health/module2" target="_blank">Unite for Site suggests that,</a> many cultures have viewed mental illness as a form of religious punishment or demonic possession. In ancient Egyptian, Indian, Greek, and Roman writings, mental illness was categorized as a religious or personal problem. In the 5th century B.C., Hippocrates was a pioneer in treating mentally ill people with techniques not rooted in religion or superstition; instead, he focused on changing a mentally ill patient’s environment or occupation, or administering certain substances as medications. During the Middle Ages, the mentally ill were believed to be possessed or in need of religion. Negative attitudes towards mental illness persisted into the 18th century in the United States, leading to stigmatization of mental illness, and unhygienic (and often degrading) confinement of mentally ill individuals.</p>

<p>This institutional inpatient care model, in which many patients lived in hospitals and were treated by professional staff, was considered the most effective way to care for the mentally ill. Institutionalization was also welcomed by families and communities struggling to care for mentally ill relatives. Although institutionalized care increased patient access to mental health services, the state hospitals were often underfunded and understaffed, and the institutional care system drew harsh criticism following a number of high-profile reports of poor living conditions and human rights violations. By the mid-1950s, a push for deinstitutionalization and outpatient treatment began in many countries, facilitated by the development of a variety of antipsychotic drugs. Deinstitutionalization efforts have reflected a largely international movement to reform the “asylum-based” mental health care system and move toward community-oriented care, based on the belief that psychiatric patients would have a higher quality of life if treated in their communities rather than in “large, undifferentiated, and isolated mental hospitals”.</p>
<h3>More Recent Years</h3>
<p>Although large inpatient psychiatric hospitals are a fixture in certain countries, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, the deinstitutionalization movement has been widespread, dramatically changing the nature of modern psychiatric care. The closure of state psychiatric hospitals in the United States was codified by the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963, and strict standards were passed so that only individuals “who posed an imminent danger to themselves or someone else” could be committed to state psychiatric hospitals. By the mid-1960s in the U.S., many severely mentally ill people had been moved from psychiatric institutions to local mental health homes or similar facilities. The number of institutionalized mentally ill patients fell from its peak of 560,000 in the 1950s to 130,000 by 1980. By 2000, the number of state psychiatric hospital beds per 100,000 people was 22, down from 339 in 1955. In place of institutionalized care, community-based mental health care was developed to include a range of treatment facilities, from community mental health centers and smaller supervised residential homes to community-based psychiatric teams.<a href="https://www.uniteforsight.org/mental-health/module2" target="_blank">To learn more about the history of mental health, visit Unite Forsight.</a></p>
<h3>Now that you know the history of what mentally ill people have been through, it is now time to talk about why the stigma surrounding mental health needs to be abolished. Mental health is also known as a taboo topic mainly because of the history surrounding mental health.</h3>
<p> A taboo is a social or religious custom prohibiting or forbidding discussion of a particular practice or forbidding association with a particular person, place, or thing.(Oxford)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477" target="_blank">The Mayo Clinic states, </a>stigma is when someone views you in a negative way because you have a distinguishing characteristic or personal trait that's thought to be, or actually is, a disadvantage (a negative stereotype). Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common.</p>
<p>Stigma can lead to discrimination. Discrimination may be obvious and direct, such as someone making a negative remark about your mental illness or your treatment. Or it may be unintentional or subtle, such as someone avoiding you because the person assumes you could be unstable, violent or dangerous due to your mental illness. You may even judge yourself.</p>
<p>Some of the harmful effects of stigma can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reluctance to seek help or treatment</li> 
<li>Lack of understanding by family, friends, co-workers or others</li>
<li>Fewer opportunities for work, school, or social activities or trouble finding housing</li>
<li>Bullying, pysical violence, or harassment</li>
<li>Helath insurance that doesn't adequately cover your mental illness treatment</li>
<li>The belief that you'll never succeed at certain challenges or that you can't improve your situation</li>
</ul>
<h1>Now how to help</h1>
<p>There are many ways to help dissolve the stigma and tabooness surrounding the conversation of mental health. Here are a few that are both suggested by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mental-illness/in-depth/mental-health/art-20046477" target="_blank">the Mayo Clinic</a> and suggested from personal experience.</p>
<ul>
<ul><b>Don't shut down:</b> when someone is speaking with you about their mental health in the moment or about their journey, do not shut down and become a person that are unfamiliar with when they trusted you enough to share this information with you. Be understanding and as accepting as you can be.</ul>
<ul><b>Share your story:</b> whether you share your story with other people in person, online, or to yourself with journaling, share it. It helps to share your story when you feel alone, because in reality, you are not alone. Sharing your story will help you to realize this, even if it is to yourself.</ul>
<ul><b>Get treatment:</b> you may feel like you do not need treatment or are told that you are making a bigger deal of your mental health than what you think it is. You aren't. Treatment can provide relief and validation by identifying what is wrong and reducing the symptoms that are interfering with your life.</ul>
<ul><b>Don't let stigma create self-doubt and shame:</b> stigma doesn't just come from others. You may mistakenly believe that your condition is a sign of personal weakness or that you should be able to control it without help. Seeking counseling, educating yourself about your condition and connecting with others who have mental illness can help you gain self-esteem and overcome destructive self-judgment.</ul>
<ul><b>Don't isolate yourself:</b> If you have a mental illness, you may be reluctant to tell anyone about it. Your family, friends, clergy or members of your community can offer you support if they know about your mental illness. Reach out to people you trust for the compassion, support and understanding you need.</ul>
<ul><b>Don't equate yourself with your illness:</b> you are not an illness. So instead of saying "I'm depressed," say "I have depression." Instead of saying "I'm bipolar," say "I have bipolar disorder.</ul>
<ul><b>Joind a suppoprt group:</b> some local and national groups, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), offer local programs and internet resources that help reduce stigma by educating people who have mental illness, their families and the general public. Some state and federal agencies and programs, such as those that focus on vocational rehabilitation and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), offer support for people with mental illness.</ul>
<ul><b>Speak out against stigma:</b> consider expressing your opinions at events, in letters to the editor or on the internet. It can help instill courage in others facing similar challenges and educate the public about mental illness.</ul>
</ul>
<p>Others' judgments almost always stem from a lack of understanding rather than information based on facts. Learning to accept your condition and recognize what you need to do to treat it, seeking support, and helping educate others can make a big difference.</p>
