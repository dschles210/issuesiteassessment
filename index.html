<p>In 2020, a pandemic hit the world. Not only did a pandemic hit, but also a mental health epidemic in result from the pandemic. Mental health has never had more recognition than it did during the pandemic. So what? Now that there are no lockdowns, people are back at wrok, kids back at school, etc. the conversation around mental health has fell off. Mental health needs to be a national conversation in order to ensure adults and the growing generation there are enough funds and resources to help those that need it.</p>
<br>
<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with mental health challenges related to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease and to mitigation activities, including the impact of physical distancing and stay-at-home orders. Symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder increased considerably in the United States during April–June of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href=" https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm" target="_blank">In a website by the CDC, they state </a>during June 24–30, 2020, a total of 5,412 (54.7%) of 9,896 eligible invited adults completed web-based surveys administered by Qualtrics. The Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee of Monash University (Melbourne, Australia) reviewed and approved the study protocol on human subjects research. Respondents were informed of the study purposes and provided electronic consent before commencement, and investigators received anonymized responses. Participants included 3,683 (68.1%) first-time respondents and 1,729 (31.9%) respondents who had completed a related survey during April 2–8, May 5–12, 2020, or both intervals; 1,497 (27.7%) respondents participated during all three intervals. Quota sampling and survey weighting were employed to improve cohort representativeness of the U.S. population by gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder were assessed using the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and symptoms of a COVID-19–related TSRD were assessed using the six-item Impact of Event Scale. Respondents also reported whether they had started or increased substance use to cope with stress or emotions related to COVID-19 or seriously considered suicide in the 30 days preceding the survey.</p>
 <h3>Survey and the Numbers</h3>
<p>To assess mental health, substance use, and suicidal ideation during the pandemic, <a href=" https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm" target="_blank">representative panel surveys were conducted by the CDC </a> among adults aged ≥18 years across the United States during June 24–30, 2020. Overall, 40.9% of respondents reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition, including symptoms of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder (30.9%), symptoms of a trauma- and stressor-related disorder (TSRD) related to the pandemic (26.3%), and having started or increased substance use to cope with stress or emotions related to COVID-19 (13.3%). The percentage of respondents who reported having seriously considered suicide in the 30 days before completing the survey (10.7%) was significantly higher among respondents aged 18–24 years (25.5%), minority racial/ethnic groups (Hispanic respondents [18.6%], non-Hispanic black [black] respondents [15.1%]), self-reported unpaid caregivers for adults (30.7%), and essential workers (21.7%). Prevalence of symptoms of adverse mental or behavioral health conditions varied significantly among subgroups. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among males than among females. Symptoms of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder, COVID-19–related TSRD, initiation of or increase in substance use to cope with COVID-19–associated stress, and serious suicidal ideation in the previous 30 days were most commonly reported by persons aged 18–24 years; prevalence decreased progressively with age.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> Future studies should identify drivers of adverse mental and behavioral health during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether factors such as social isolation, absence of school structure, unemployment and other financial worries, and various forms of violence (e.g., physical, emotional, mental, or sexual abuse) serve as additional stressors. Community-level intervention and prevention efforts should include strengthening economic supports to reduce financial strain, addressing stress from experienced racial discrimination, promoting social connectedness, and supporting persons at risk for suicide.</p>
